1Test of Dawson's Integral vs Taylor expansion


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.06, 1.00)


  F(X) was larger  2000 times,
           agreed     0 times, and
      was smaller     0 times.


 There are  24 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of     0.1140E+00 =    2 **  -3.13
    occurred for X = 0.999698E+00
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is  20.87


 The root mean square relative error was     0.6794E-01 =    2 **  -3.88
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is  20.12


1Test of Dawson's Integral vs Taylor expansion


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 1.00, 2.50)


  F(X) was larger     0 times,
           agreed     0 times, and
      was smaller  2000 times.


 There are  24 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of       Infinity =    2 **    Inf
    occurred for X = 0.100031E+01
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is    Inf


 The root mean square relative error was       Infinity =    2 **    Inf
 The estimated loss of base   2 significant digits is    Inf

 Test of special arguments


  F(XMIN) =  0.00000000000000000E+00

 Test of Error Returns



 DAW will be called with the argument 0.423691E+38
 This should not underflow


 DAW returned the value 0.000000E+00



 DAW will be called with the argument 0.425353E+38
 This may underflow


 DAW returned the value 0.000000E+00



 DAW will be called with the argument 0.427014E+38
 This may underflow


 DAW returned the value 0.000000E+00



 This concludes the tests
Note: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG IEEE_DENORMAL
