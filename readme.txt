Test procedure
--------------

FORTRAN users: Compile TUNB3M program with the other subroutines (UNB3M, 
 UNB3MM, UNB3MR). Run the executable. Compare the file created 
 (tunb3m.txt) with the one provided with the package (tunb3m_.txt).

MatLab users: Put all *.m files in the same directory. Run TUNB3M 
 function. Compare the file created (tunb3m.txt) with the one provided
 with the package (tunb3m_.txt).
