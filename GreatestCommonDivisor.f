! ---------------------------------------------------------
! This program computes the GCD of two positive integers
! using the Euclid method.  Given a and b, a >= b, the
! Euclid method goes as follows:  (1) dividing a by b yields
! a reminder c; (2) if c is zero, b is the GCD; (3) if c is
! no zero, b becomes a and c becomes c and go back to
! Step (1).  This process will continue until c is zero.
